INSTRUCTIONS
Move with the cursor keys or WASD.

You can move along existing (green) lines freely (including internal ones).

To start making a new area, press and hold the space key.

Get hit and you die. You have three lives.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
To build the game, you will need the SDL libraries. A project file for
Code::Blocks is included, but making it yourself should be pretty easy.
Just compile and link with all source files and the SDL library.
